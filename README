This is the root folder for the Control Sheet project.

The project aims to create a computer aid for GMing
the GURPS 4e Roleplaying game by Steve Jackson Games.
The aid takes the form of the GM Control Sheet presented
in the GURPS Campaigns Book. At the very least it will
replicate the functionality of the Control Sheet.
Some possible additional features include: reminders
for various roles for injury, compatiablilty with the
GCA.
